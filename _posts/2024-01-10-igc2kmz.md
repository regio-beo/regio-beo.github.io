Some of you might know the nice igc2kmz converter written by Tom Payne [https://github.com/twpayne/igc2kmz](https://github.com/twpayne/igc2kmz).

The code works fine, but is written for Python2 which is not really supported anymore.
Short story long: use the following Dockerfile in order to create a Python2 environment:

```
FROM alpine:3.15

# This hack is widely applied to avoid python printing issues in docker containers.
# See: https://github.com/Docker-Hub-frolvlad/docker-alpine-python3/pull/13
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

RUN apk add --no-cache python2 && \
    python -m ensurepip && \
    rm -r /usr/lib/python*/ensurepip && \
    pip install --upgrade pip setuptools && \
    rm -r /root/.cache
RUN apk add --no-cache git

RUN git clone https://github.com/twpayne/igc2kmz

WORKDIR /tmp
ENTRYPOINT ["/igc2kmz/bin/igc2kmz.py"]
```

Then you create your image. With that image you can create the following `alias` in order to use it from the commandline:

```
alias igc2kmz='/usr/bin/docker run --rm -ti -u 1000:1000 -v /home/benjamin/Downloads:/tmp 93aa745855ec'
```

This mounts `~/Downloads` directly to the working dir `~/tmp`.
